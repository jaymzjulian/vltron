About the development
---------------------

Despite having been started around six months ago, the majority of this game was actually completed in the first couple of weeks - most of the rest was a combination of writing tooling and getting to grips with the platform, although much like everyone else, 2020 has been.... a year.  Yeah.  But there is vectrex!  I did spend weeks on the sound effects, because I am a ridiculous human being who cannot do anything normal.  The good news is that the tooling all translates across to my other games, so the completion of those should be a LOT faster.  

Definitly a less complex game next, as a palette cleanser, before my next more complicated one.  There are a couple in flight, and I'll hopefully finish one of them soon!  But as learning and pushing the platform has gone, this one has worked out okay.
